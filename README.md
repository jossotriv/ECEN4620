Upload box_Dev.ino into the Client ("BOX") microcontroller and wand_Dev.ino into the Server ("Wand") microcontroller. The reset signal on the Wand microcontroller and the LED digital pin in the "BOX" can be customized to find any digital pin that you'd like to use and have access to.

Here's the project links for the pcb and wand in Easy EDA:

*Note if you are exporting the Easy EDA modules to Altium, the header pins for the ESP32 devkit do not show on altium. You can change the header pin footprint on Easy EDA if you'd like to export it to Altium.

box 4.dxf is the output of CorelDraw for the wand encasing that you put into a laser cutter to recreate the wand encasing.
